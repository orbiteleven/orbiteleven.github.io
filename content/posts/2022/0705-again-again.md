Here we go again. Another year, another attempt at blogging. Let's see how this goes.

The nitty gritty this time:
 - I'm using Eleventy as my site generator. I'd heard about it on a [Jamstack podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/dk/podcast/jamstack-radio/id1148797643) and figured since I spend most of programming time in JS I should choose a JS-based site generator, but since I don't really do much with this blog it might as well be static.
 - I'm using the [eleventy-chirpy-blog-template](https://github.com/muenzpraeger/eleventy-chirpy-blog-template) thanks to [Ren√© Winkelmeyer](https://blog.winkelmeyer.com), since my design skills are crap.
 - I'm hosting on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), because... well, just wanted to give it a try.
